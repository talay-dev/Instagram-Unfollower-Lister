# Instagram Unfollowers Checker

## Description

This is a simple Python script that utilizes the Instagram API to list all the people whom you follow but who don't follow you back. To use this script, you'll need to provide a valid Instagram username and password within the script.

You can specify a target user, which can either be your own username or someone else's, as long as you are following that user or the user's profile is public.
