# Instagram Unfollowers Checker

## Description

This is a simple Python script that utilizes the Instagram API to list all the people whom you follow but who don't follow you back. To use this script, you'll need to login to your Instagram account and use cookies to authenticate yourself.

You can specify a target user, which can either be your own username or someone else's, as long as you are following that user or the user's profile is public.
